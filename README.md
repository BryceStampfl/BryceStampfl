Thanks for visiting my profile! I have been programming for around 6 years now, with 3ish years professional experience.
I have tons of different hobbies but recently I started drawing, making music with a synth in a DAW, and playing my electric guitar.
I am social and when its not covid I like to go out and make friends. I am also active and love yoga and working out!
