Thanks for visiting my profile! I have been programming for around 6 years now, with 3ish years professional experience. I started teaching myself Java and python before I went into the major and fell in love making programs.

I consider myself a full stack dev with the most experience in Springboot(Java) and React(JS) 

What else do i do?
I have tons of different hobbies but recently I started drawing, making music with a synth in a DAW, and playing my electric guitar.
I am social and when its not covid I like to go out and make friends. I like to travel (Germany, Japan, Bali) and sometimes go to festivals. I am also active and love yoga and working out!
